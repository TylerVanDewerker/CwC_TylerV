# What belongs in the Design folder?
The design folder should contain all deliverables created related to the game's *design* such as:
* Your Game Design Document (GDD)
* Level designs
* Dialogue scripts
* User Interface design
* User Interface flow

If you are managing design documents elsewhere, at least include a document a link to the location where such documents can be found.
