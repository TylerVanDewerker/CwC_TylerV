# UnityProjectTemplate
Use this template for game projects built in Unity

**NOTE:** This repository template is configured to use LFS for *.blend, *.psd, *.tiff, and *.tif files.   To add additional files to the LFS storage use the command
git lfs track

## If you have already created your Unity project locally
1. Create a new repository using this repository as a template. 
>* Select "Use this template".  
>* Name the new repository the same name you used for the existing Unity Project name followed by -Repo.   
3. Using Git GUI, _Clone existing repository_  to clone this repository to your desktop
4. Copy the existing Unity project folder into the cloned _Unity Project_-Repo directory.  It should end up as a folder at the same level as the Art and Design folders, nested within the repository folder.
5. Move the **_UnityProjectRoot.gitignore** file into your **Unity project** folder AND rename to **.gitignore**
6. In Git GUI, click **Rescan**.  Make sure that your project files show up and number of files is reasonable (should **not** be 10's of thousands of files)
7. Click **Stage changed**
8. Add a meaningful commit message such as "Initial commit of _project name_" and click **Commit**
9. Click **Push** to push the committed changes to GitHub.  _Remember you'll need to go to GitHub to create, review and merge a pull request on GitHub.com to finish applying your commits to the repository._
11. Continue working locally and committing frequently.  You should **at least** do one COMMIT **and** one PUSH per class period.  More is better!

## If you have NOT created your Unity project locally yet
1. Create a new repository using this repository as a template. 
>* Select "Use this template".  
>* Name the new repository the same name you'll use for your Unity Project name followed by -Repo.
3. Using Git GUI, Clone the new repository to your desktop
4. In the Unity Hub, create a new project with same name as the repository minus the -Repo.  Be sure to set the location for the project as the new Repo folder.  This way the new Unity project will be created __inside__ the repository folder, at same level as Art and Design folders.
5. Once the project opens in Unity, go to File Explorer and Move the **_UnityProjectRoot.gitignore** file up into your **Unity project** folder and rename to **.gitignore**
7. In Git GUI, click **Rescan**.  Make sure that your project files show up and number of files is reasonable (should **not** be 10's of thousands of files)
8. Click **Stage changed**
9. Add a meaningful commit message such as "Initial commit of _project name_" and click **Commit**  _Note: If you may need to close the Unity project. 
10. Click **Push** to push the committed changes to GitHub.  _Remember you'll need to go to GitHub to create, review and merge a pull request on GitHub.com to finish applying your commits to the repository._
11. Continue working locally and committing frequently.  You should **at least** do one COMMIT **and** one PUSH per day to minimize risk of lost work.
