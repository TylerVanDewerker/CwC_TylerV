# What belongs in the Art folder for your game project?
You should store all art found or created for the project in this folder.  This includes art that may or may not ever be included in the game such as:
* concept art  
* inspiration art
* 3D models
* material images
* texture images
* Animation
* Pixel art

Add appropriate subfolders as needed to keep the art organized (e.g. Concept art, Environment, Character, Animation, etc.)
